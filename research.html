        <h1>Research</h1>
        <h2>This is the research conducted by our team</h2>
        <h4>Because of global warming, many penguin lose their habitats.
            The heat causes the frozen ice that they breed and live on to melt.
            If this continues then over 90% of emperor penguin colonies could be gone before the end of the century
            Not only that, global warming also causes rising sea levels. Rising sea levels doesn't allow penguins safe nesting sites.
            Many coastal nesting sites for penguins are flooded. In 2022, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed emperor penguins as threatened and endangered.
            Since they rely on ice for protection, predators, and for breeding many are becoming endangered.
            The Northern rockhopper penguin population has been declining since the 1950s.
            Since then there has been an estimated 90% decline in their population.
            Yellow-eyed penguins is widely considered one of the rarest penguins in the world and reside in mainly uninhibited islands.
            The humboldt, White-flippered, Fiordland crested, Erect-crested and more species of penguin are threatened under the endangered species act.
